Generate a structured directory layout for this project and the corresponding boilerplate code.

The output should be in this exact format:

{ "structure": [ ("path/to/file", "type"), # type is either "file" or "folder" ], "boilerplate": { "path/to/file": "content of file with \n for newlines", }, "scripts": [ "script command 1", "script command 2", ] }

Here's an example of what the output should look like:

{ "structure": [ ("src", "folder"), ("src/components", "folder"), ("src/pages", "folder"), ("src/App.tsx", "file"), ("src/main.tsx", "file"), ("public", "folder"), ("public/manifest.json", "file"), ("package.json", "file"), ("tsconfig.json", "file"), ("tailwind.config.ts", "file"), ("postcss.config.ts", "file"), ("vite.config.ts", "file"), ("index.html", "file") ], "boilerplate": { "src/App.tsx": "import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";\n\nfunction App() {\n return (\n <div className="flex items-center justify-center h-screen">\n <Button>Click me</Button>\n </div>\n );\n}\n\nexport default App;", "src/main.tsx": "import React from "react";\nimport ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";\nimport App from "./App";\nimport "./index.css";\n\nReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root") as HTMLElement).render(\n <React.StrictMode>\n <App />\n </React.StrictMode>\n);", "public/manifest.json": "{\n "short_name": "App",\n "name": "Project Name",\n "icons": [],\n "start_url": ".",\n "display": "standalone",\n "theme_color": "#ffffff",\n "background_color": "#ffffff"\n}", "package.json": "{\n "name": "project-name",\n "version": "0.1.0",\n "private": true,\n "dependencies": {\n "react": "^18.0.0",\n "react-dom": "^18.0.0",\n "@shadcn/ui": "latest"\n },\n "devDependencies": {\n "typescript": "^5.0.0",\n "vite": "^4.0.0",\n "tailwindcss": "latest",\n "postcss": "latest",\n "autoprefixer": "latest"\n }\n}", "tsconfig.json": "{\n "compilerOptions": {\n "target": "esnext",\n "module": "esnext",\n "jsx": "react-jsx",\n "strict": true\n }\n}", "tailwind.config.ts": "import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss';\n\nconst config: Config = {\n content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{ts,tsx}"],\n theme: {\n extend: {},\n },\n plugins: [],\n};\n\nexport default config;", "postcss.config.ts": "export default {\n plugins: {\n tailwindcss: {},\n autoprefixer: {},\n },\n};", "vite.config.ts": "import { defineConfig } from "vite";\nimport react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n plugins: [react()],\n});", "index.html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n <meta charset="UTF-8" />\n <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />\n <link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json" />\n <title>Project Name</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n <div id="root"></div>\n <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>\n</body>\n</html>" }, "scripts": [ "npm install", "npm run dev", "npm run build", "npm run preview" ] }
